Checklist (TAKE THESE STEPS) : 
 Memory Utilization alerts that has exceeded the Memory Warning Threshold (%%) might indicate an issue with server or application.  Please take the following steps:

ITOps: 
1. Capture screenshot of task manager (detailed view sorted by memory) so we can see what is causing the high memory utilization at that time. 
2. Search for additional incidents related to the application running on server (looking for customer impact). If there are other Application related Incidents related to this server collaborate (work with) the Application owner to determine next steps.
    2a. As you work with the Application owner the memory consumption is justified or understood, make notes in the Incident and take no action,. 
    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required. 
3. Route the Incident to L2 Windows team for analysis with the Application owner based on the screenshots provided to determine if Monitoring should be tuned for this specific application and server combination. Create the Task through the Service Catalog / Portal to Tune Monitoring. Include the server host and application name. Suggest a threshold which is more appropriate for this server / application combination.

Please Note all steps you are taking, who you are speaking with, what decisions are made, and outcomes (including Close Notes). Do not simply add close notes without detail notes around actions taken. ",,,,,

Checklist (TAKE THESE STEPS) : 
 Memory Utilization alerts that has exceeded the Memory Warning Threshold (%%) might indicate an issue with server or application.  Please take the following steps:

ITOps: 
1. Capture screenshot of task manager (detailed view sorted by memory) so we can see what is causing the high memory utilization at that time. 
2. Search for additional incidents related to the application running on server (looking for customer impact). If there are other Application related Incidents related to this server collaborate (work with) the Application owner to determine next steps.
    2a. As you work with the Application owner the memory consumption is justified or understood, make notes in the Incident and take no action,. 
    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required. 
3. Route the Incident to L2 Windows team for analysis with the Application owner based on the screenshots provided to determine if Monitoring should be tuned for this specific application and server combination. Create the Task through the Service Catalog / Portal to Tune Monitoring. Include the server host and application name. Suggest a threshold which is more appropriate for this server / application combination.

Please Note all steps you are taking, who you are speaking with, what decisions are made, and outcomes (including Close Notes). Do not simply add close notes without detail notes around actions taken. ",,,,,

Order was canceled however it is showing up in ""ready for delivery pickup"". When I try to cancel entire order an error message pops up that says ""one of the orders lines is currently in a status that prevents modification. Please verify whether the modification is allowed before continuing.""  And there are no additional steps that I can do to continue to cancel. The order needs to be completely canceled and removed from the system.

Checklist (TAKE THESE STEPS) : 
 Memory Utilization alerts that has exceeded the Memory Warning Threshold (%%) might indicate an issue with server or application.  Please take the following steps:

ITOps: 
1. Capture screenshot of task manager (detailed view sorted by memory) so we can see what is causing the high memory utilization at that time. 
2. Search for additional incidents related to the application running on server (looking for customer impact). If there are other Application related Incidents related to this server collaborate (work with) the Application owner to determine next steps.
    2a. As you work with the Application owner the memory consumption is justified or understood, make notes in the Incident and take no action,. 
    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required. 
3. Route the Incident to L2 Windows team for analysis with the Application owner based on the screenshots provided to determine if Monitoring should be tuned for this specific application and server combination. Create the Task through the Service Catalog / Portal to Tune Monitoring. Include the server host and application name. Suggest a threshold which is more appropriate for this server / application combination.

Please Note all steps you are taking, who you are speaking with, what decisions are made, and outcomes (including Close Notes). Do not simply add close notes without detail notes around actions taken. ",,,,,

Checklist (TAKE THESE STEPS) : 
 Memory Utilization alerts that has exceeded the Memory Warning Threshold (%%) might indicate an issue with server or application.  Please take the following steps:

ITOps: 
1. Capture screenshot of task manager (detailed view sorted by memory) so we can see what is causing the high memory utilization at that time. 
2. Search for additional incidents related to the application running on server (looking for customer impact). If there are other Application related Incidents related to this server collaborate (work with) the Application owner to determine next steps.
    2a. As you work with the Application owner the memory consumption is justified or understood, make notes in the Incident and take no action,. 
    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required. 
3. Route the Incident to L2 Windows team for analysis with the Application owner based on the screenshots provided to determine if Monitoring should be tuned for this specific application and server combination. Create the Task through the Service Catalog / Portal to Tune Monitoring. Include the server host and application name. Suggest a threshold which is more appropriate for this server / application combination.

Please Note all steps you are taking, who you are speaking with, what decisions are made, and outcomes (including Close Notes). Do not simply add close notes without detail notes around actions taken. ",,,,,

Comments: As noted my order for a Blackstone flat-top griddle was made 11-29-23.  Said order was picked up the afternoon of 12-06-23.  The folks loading the item stated I should receive a phone call within 72 hours for assembly date.   I have NOT received a call.  12-13-23 I called the support number staying on the phone for 45 minutes.  I failed to write individuals name down.  It seemed the assembly group couldn't pull my order up to confirm.  I was to have received an email telling me when to expect someone.  Still no one has called.  This is a Christmas present and I wasn't in a rush to get assembly completed.  I would however, appreciate someone telling me when I can expect someone to come assemble.   After all I paid a fee of $189.00 for this service.  Thank you  Susan Brazelle

Checklist (TAKE THESE STEPS) : 
 Memory Utilization alerts that has exceeded the Memory Warning Threshold (%%) might indicate an issue with server or application.  Please take the following steps:

ITOps: 
1. Capture screenshot of task manager (detailed view sorted by memory) so we can see what is causing the high memory utilization at that time. 
2. Search for additional incidents related to the application running on server (looking for customer impact). If there are other Application related Incidents related to this server collaborate (work with) the Application owner to determine next steps.
    2a. As you work with the Application owner the memory consumption is justified or understood, make notes in the Incident and take no action,. 
    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required. 
3. Route the Incident to L2 Windows team for analysis with the Application owner based on the screenshots provided to determine if Monitoring should be tuned for this specific application and server combination. Create the Task through the Service Catalog / Portal to Tune Monitoring. Include the server host and application name. Suggest a threshold which is more appropriate for this server / application combination.

Please Note all steps you are taking, who you are speaking with, what decisions are made, and outcomes (including Close Notes). Do not simply add close notes without detail notes around actions taken. ",,,,,

    2a. As you work with the Application owner the memory consumption is justified or understood, make notes in the Incident and take no action,. 
    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required. 
3. Route the Incident to L2 Windows team for analysis with the Application owner based on the screenshots provided to determine if Monitoring should be tuned for this specific application and server combination. Create the Task through the Service Catalog / Portal to Tune Monitoring. Include the server host and application name.

Checklist (TAKE THESE STEPS) : 
 Memory Utilization alerts that has exceeded the Memory Warning Threshold (%%) might indicate an issue with server or application.  Please take the following steps:

ITOps: 
1. Capture screenshot of task manager (detailed view sorted by memory) so we can see what is causing the high memory utilization at that time. 
2. Search for additional incidents related to the application running on server (looking for customer impact). If there are other Application related Incidents related to this server collaborate (work with) the Application owner to determine next steps.
    2a. As you work with the Application owner the memory consumption is justified or understood, make notes in the Incident and take no action,. 
    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required. 
3. Route the Incident to L2 Windows team for analysis with the Application owner based on the screenshots provided to determine if Monitoring should be tuned for this specific application and server combination. Create the Task through the Service Catalog / Portal to Tune Monitoring. Include the server host and application name. Suggest a threshold which is more appropriate for this server / application combination.

Please Note all steps you are taking, who you are speaking with, what decisions are made, and outcomes (including Close Notes). Do not simply add close notes without detail notes around actions taken. ",,,,,

When people go on our website and put in wood pellets the first thing that comes up is softwood pellets.  They don't realize this and they order them.  Then when their order comes through we have to call them and ask them if they really want softwood pellets. Noone wants softwood pellets.  We have to cancel their order and then they have to reorder them.  Any way that hardwood can be the first search result that comes up for wood pellets.  Thanks in advance for your help

We have an order for Rick Greub in our ""Ship to Store"" tab, and I want to check on the status the order. The reason is because it has been sitting in our system since 11/27/22!!! Plus, when I check the tracking, it has been stuck on waiting carrier. I was also wondering if this order is truly a ""no show order"" that this order could be canceled and taken out of our system.

 Memory Utilization alerts that has exceeded the Memory Warning Threshold (%%) might indicate an issue with server or application.  Please take the following steps:

ITOps: 
1. Capture screenshot of task manager (detailed view sorted by memory) so we can see what is causing the high memory utilization at that time. 
2. Search for additional incidents related to the application running on server (looking for customer impact). If there are other Application related Incidents related to this server collaborate (work with) the Application owner to determine next steps.
    2a. As you work with the Application owner the memory consumption is justified or understood, make notes in the Incident and take no action,. 
    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required. 
3. Route the Incident to L2 Windows team for analysis with the Application owner based on the screenshots provided to determine if Monitoring should be tuned for this specific application and server combination.

ITOps:

2. Search for additional incidents related to the application running on server (looking for customer impact). If there are other Application related Incidents related to this server collaborate (work with) the Application owner to determine next steps.
    2a. As you work with the Application owner the memory consumption is justified or understood, make notes in the Incident and take no action,. 
    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required.

ITOps: 
1. Capture screenshot of task manager (detailed view sorted by memory) so we can see what is causing the high memory utilization at that time. 
2. Search for additional incidents related to the application running on server (looking for customer impact). If there are other Application related Incidents related to this server collaborate (work with) the Application owner to determine next steps.
    2a. As you work with the Application owner the memory consumption is justified or understood, make notes in the Incident and take no action,. 
    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required. 
3. Route the Incident to L2 Windows team for analysis with the Application owner based on the screenshots provided to determine if Monitoring should be tuned for this specific application and server combination.

Please Note all steps you are taking, who you are speaking with, what decisions are made, and outcomes (including Close Notes). Do not simply add close notes without detail notes around actions taken. ",,,,,

Checklist (TAKE THESE STEPS) : 
 Memory Utilization alerts that has exceeded the Memory Warning Threshold (%%) might indicate an issue with server or application.  Please take the following steps:

ITOps: 
1. Capture screenshot of task manager (detailed view sorted by memory) so we can see what is causing the high memory utilization at that time. 
2. Search for additional incidents related to the application running on server (looking for customer impact). If there are other Application related Incidents related to this server collaborate (work with) the Application owner to determine next steps.
    2a. As you work with the Application owner the memory consumption is justified or understood, make notes in the Incident and take no action,. 
    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required. 
3. Route the Incident to L2 Windows team for analysis with the Application owner based on the screenshots provided to determine if Monitoring should be tuned for this specific application and server combination. Create the Task through the Service Catalog / Portal to Tune Monitoring. Include the server host and application name. Suggest a threshold which is more appropriate for this server / application combination.

Please Note all steps you are taking, who you are speaking with, what decisions are made, and outcomes (including Close Notes). Do not simply add close notes without detail notes around actions taken. ",,,,,

    2b. If the Application owner deems it helpful, you need to coordinate rebooting the server and restarting the application (may require more than the server you are haveing the memory issue with).  Coordination with the Application owner is required. 
3. Route the Incident to L2 Windows team for analysis with the Application owner based on the screenshots provided to determine if Monitoring should be tuned for this specific application and server combination. Create the Task through the Service Catalog / Portal to Tune Monitoring. Include the server host and application name. Suggest a threshold which is more appropriate for this server / application combination.

Please Note all steps you are taking, who you are speaking with, what decisions are made, and outcomes (including Close Notes). Do not simply add close notes without detail notes around actions taken. ",,,,,

This order has been sitting as ""shipped"" for nearly 2 years now. The tracking information shows that it has never been picked up by the carrier, and I'm wondering if we can follow up to figure out why it never got shipped and if the customer should just be refunded.
